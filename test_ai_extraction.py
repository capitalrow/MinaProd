So from here, let me take that as an action. Another action that I need to do is I need to go back upstairs to my living room, or my bedroom, sorry, and clean it up. Let's do this right away today. I need to then go downstairs and get 30 pounds out as cash from the ATM machine after I've filled out the bedroom. I also need to then go back home and buy a train ticket for tomorrow to work. I also need to book a desk on the desk booking app for the office. I'm also planning to prepare to buy Christmas gifts around late November time. I also need to define my handover tasks at work before I leave and move on to my new role at Monzo. I also need to write a New Year's resolution plan for the new year coming."""
