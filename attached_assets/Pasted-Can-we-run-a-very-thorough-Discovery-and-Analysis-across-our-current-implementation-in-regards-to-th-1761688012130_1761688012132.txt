Can we run a very thorough Discovery and Analysis across our current implementation in regards to the page showing in the attached screenshot in order to ensure and confirm whether we are exactly 100% aligned with the following event sequencing exactly as described in the following description, The following is what I expect as my target state on how I expect the task page to function and respond to the user when a user interacts with the page BS detailed as possible in your Discovery and Analysis: ⚙️ CROWN⁴.5 — Mina Tasks Event Sequencing & Logic Flow (Final Enterprise-Grade Standard)

> “Presence as Continuity — Action you can trust.”

Every task in Mina is a contract with the future — captured once, kept in order, and always in sync.




---

1️⃣ Global Philosophy

Each task in Mina represents intent converted into motion — living proof of progress derived directly from real conversation context.

Core Tenets

Atomic precision → Every task event is one logical truth.

Deterministic order → Chronology never guessed, always validated.

Predictive continuity → Mina anticipates user intent across sessions.

Emotionally-balanced flow → Calm, tactile, human feedback for every state change.

Idempotent integrity → Replays never duplicate or regress.

Session lineage → Each task remains anchored to its originating meeting and transcript.



---

2️⃣ Lifecycle Overview

User Action (click / type / accept / idle)
→ Immediate Feedback (visual or haptic micro-response)
→ Backend Event (WS / REST)
→ EventSequencer Validation (order + checksum)
→ TaskStore Delta Merge (field-level diff)
→ UI Transition (Optimistic)
→ Server Confirmation (Truth Reconciliation)
→ Persist + Broadcast (Ledger + Cache + Multi-Tab Sync)

💡 Principle: Instant optimism, guaranteed truth.

Task	Core actionable unit	task_id, title, status, priority, due_at, assignee, labels[], source, session_id, transcript_span, confidence, origin_hash, created_at, updated_at
TaskViewState	UI & filter layer	filter, sort, query, selected_ids[], toast_state, last_event_id
TaskCounters	Aggregates	all, pending, completed
SessionContext	Shared cross-domain link	session_id, transcript_span, origin_message, context_confidence, derived_entities[]

5️⃣ Flow Narratives

🟢 Stage A — Arrival (“It remembers.”)

Cache paints <200 ms.

Counters & tabs render instantly.

WS replays missed deltas deterministically.

Silent checksum reconciliation maintains trust.


Principle: Familiarity = confidence.


---

🔵 Stage B — Capture (“Action without friction.”)

Manual composer opens inline; enter = save, esc = cancel.

AI suggestions fade in softly, never modal.

Context stored via SessionContext (service shared with transcript).


Principle: Capture = instant and safe.


---

🟣 Stage C — Edit & Complete (“Fluid control.”)

Edits debounce, persist quietly.

Completion animates + reorders optimistically.

Priority, due, assign chips animate consistently.


Principle: Micro-changes, macro-clarity.


---

⚪ Stage D — Organise & Recall (“Calm order.”)

Local filters + semantic cluster mode group by intention (“Follow-ups”, “Decisions”).

Snoozed tasks visually tucked away.

“Jump to transcript” morphs context; return restores scroll state.


Principle: Order without effort.


---

🟡 Stage E — Continuity (“Always true.”)

Idle sync + multi-tab BroadcastChannel alignment.

Offline queue → vector clock replay → truth merge.

PredictiveEngine preloads likely next tasks.


Principle: Silent intelligence.


---

6️⃣ Inter-System Cognitive Loop (Tasks ↔ Transcript ↔ Dashboard)

graph TD
A[Transcript Segment Detected] --> B[NLP Extracts Task Candidate]
B --> C{Confidence > 0.8?}
C -- yes --> D[task_nlp:proposed → WS]
C -- no --> E[Silent Suggestion Buffer]
D --> F[User Accepts → task_create:nlp_accept]
F --> G[TaskStore + SessionContext]
G --> H[Broadcast → Dashboard Counters]
H --> I[Analytics Update]
I --> J[PredictiveEngine Refines Model]

Outcome: Seamless semantic continuity — every spoken moment becomes traceable intent.
