 
Think of this as the “north star” design vision for Mina — **smart, methodical, complete**.
  
# Mina — Complete Premium User Experience Blueprint
 
## 🌟 Core Vision
 
Mina is your **meeting intelligence companion**: always ready, always clear, always trustworthy.
 
 
- It captures **everything** during meetings.
 
- It organizes what matters: decisions, risks, actions, insights.
 
- It integrates seamlessly into your **workflow** (calendars, tasks, documents, chat).
 
- It gives you full **control** over data, privacy, and collaboration.
 
- It ensures a **premium experience**: smooth, safe, human.
 

  
## 1. User Journey — End-to-End Flow
 
### **A. Before the Meeting**
 
 
- **What the user sees**: 
 
  - A clean dashboard showing Today’s meetings, Upcoming meetings, and Pending follow-ups.
 
  - Each calendar event is pre-listed (if integrated).
 
  - A large “Record” button for spontaneous or ad-hoc meetings.
 

 
 
- **What Mina does silently**: 
 
  - Pulls meeting metadata (title, time, participants) from the calendar.
 
  - Prepares profiles of known participants (speaker mapping).
 
  - Loads your preferences (e.g., language, redaction rules).
 

 
 
- **Risks considered**: 
 
  - *No calendar connected*: fallback to manual meeting creation, with a suggestion to connect later.
 
  - *Ambiguous participants*: meeting defaults to “Guest” until names are clarified.
 

 
 

  
### **B. During the Meeting**
 
 
- **What the user sees**: 
 
  - **Real-time transcript** flowing like a chat.
 
  - **Speaker labels** that self-correct as you confirm identities.
 
  - **Markers**: `/decision`, `/todo`, `/risk` appear as visual chips in the margin.
 
  - **Audio confidence meter**: assures users Mina is listening without being distracting.
 

 
 
- **What Mina does silently**: 
 
  - Detects dates, owners, and action items as they’re spoken.
 
  - Marks uncertain words with subtle highlights.
 
  - Buffers locally if the internet drops, syncing when reconnected.
 

 
 
- **Risks considered**: 
 
  - *Privacy moment*: “Pause capture” is one tap; Mina reassures you recording is paused.
 
  - *Background noise*: transcript remains readable, flagged with “[unclear]” rather than guessing.
 
  - *Multiple people speaking*: system keeps all text but marks overlap to avoid confusion.
 

 
 

  
### **C. After the Meeting**
 
 
- **What the user sees**: 
 
  - Transcript: clean, searchable, clickable by timestamp.
 
  - Summaries: 3 options (Snapshot, Executive, Structured).
 
  - Tasks: clearly written, with suggested owners/due dates.
 
  - “Share Recap” button: generates a safe link with expiry + optional redaction.
 

 
 
- **What Mina does silently**: 
 
  - Links tasks back to their spoken moment in the transcript.
 
  - Connects this meeting to past related ones (“This theme has appeared 4× this month”).
 
  - Prepares exports in multiple formats (PDF, Word, Markdown).
 

 
 
- **Risks considered**: 
 
  - *Ambiguous task ownership*: Mina suggests likely owners but defaults to “Unassigned” if unclear.
 
  - *PII exposure*: by default, share links have redaction ON and expiry dates set.
 
  - *Connectivity issues*: if meeting ended offline, Mina syncs transcript and tasks automatically once online.
 

 
 

  
### **D. Between Meetings**
 
 
- **What the user sees**: 
 
  - A daily or weekly digest: “3 tasks due, 1 unresolved risk, 1 decision carried forward.”
 
  - Insights in dashboard: recurring themes, unresolved items, and talk-time balance.
 

 
 
- **What Mina does silently**: 
 
  - Monitors open tasks and due dates.
 
  - Surfaces patterns across meetings (e.g., repeated risks, recurring agenda gaps).
 
  - Respects quiet hours: reminders never come at night or on weekends unless urgent.
 

 
 
- **Risks considered**: 
 
  - *Notification overload*: daily/weekly digest defaults, with instant alerts opt-in.
 
  - *Missed follow-ups*: tasks overdue by >X days are flagged in summaries until resolved.

## 4. Risks Considered Across the Experience
 
 
- **User trust risk**: Mina avoids hallucinated summaries by tying everything to transcripts.
 
- **Privacy risk**: Redaction ON by default, guest links expire, audit logs track sharing.
 
- **Overload risk**: Digests replace constant pings; quiet hours honored.
 
- **Accessibility risk**: UI is readable, navigable, adjustable.
 
- **Ownership risk**: If owner unclear, task defaults to “Unassigned” until confirmed.
 
- **Connectivity risk**: Offline-first capture, syncs when back online.
 
- **Error risk**: Always Undo; destructive actions confirm or roll back.
