## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application utilizes a layered architecture with Flask as the web framework and Socket.IO for real-time communication, following an application factory pattern. The frontend employs a "Crown+" design system with a dark theme, vanilla JavaScript, and Socket.IO client for a modern and accessible UI/UX.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Crown+ Design System**: Glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, consistent design tokens.
- **Theming**: Dark theme, light mode support, system preference detection.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach, tested across various breakpoints.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast/large text modes.
- **UI States**: Comprehensive loading, empty, and error states with visual indicators.
- **Component Standardization**: Standardized modals, tooltips, forms, buttons, navigation, cards, tables, and badges.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- **AI Intelligence**: Auto-summarization, key points, action items, questions, decisions, sentiment analysis, topic detection, language detection, custom AI prompts.
- **Sharing & Integrations**: Public sharing with privacy settings, embed functionality, email sharing (SendGrid), Slack integration (webhooks).
- **Real-time Audio Processing Pipeline**: Client-side VAD, WebSocket streaming, server-side processing, OpenAI Whisper API integration, real-time broadcasting.
- **Advanced AI Features**: Multi-speaker diarization, multi-language detection, adaptive VAD, real-time audio quality monitoring, confidence scoring.
- **Security & Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with RBAC, bcrypt, AES-256 encryption, rate limiting, CSP headers, CSRF protection, input validation.
- **Performance**: Low Word Error Rate (WER), sub-400ms end-to-end transcription latency, optimized database indexing.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Backend**: Flask with Flask-SocketIO.
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM (SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for prod).
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for WebSockets with polling fallback.
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap dark theme, vanilla JavaScript, Socket.IO client.
- **Data Model**: Session and Segment models.
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulated business logic (e.g., `TranscriptionService`, `AI Insights Service`).
- **Production Readiness**: Scalability, security, reliability, fault tolerance using Redis for horizontal scaling, distributed room management, session state checkpointing, robust error handling, background task retry systems, and Redis failover.
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking transcription using thread pools.
- **Continuous Audio Processing**: Overlapping context windows and sliding buffer management.
- **Advanced Deduplication**: Text stability analysis.
- **WebSocket Reliability**: Auto-reconnection, heartbeat monitoring, session recovery.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Sentry for error tracking, BetterStack for uptime, structured JSON logging, SLO/SLI metrics.
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery**: Automated, encrypted PostgreSQL backups with multi-tier retention.
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions), Alembic migrations, blue-green deployment.
