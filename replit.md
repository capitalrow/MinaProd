# Mina - Meeting Insights & Action Platform

## Overview

Mina is an enterprise-grade SaaS platform designed to transform meetings into actionable moments. It provides real-time transcription with speaker identification, voice activity detection, and AI-powered insights to generate comprehensive meeting summaries and extract actionable tasks. Its core purpose is to enhance productivity and streamline post-meeting workflows, aiming for a production-ready application with robust features and infrastructure.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application utilizes a layered architecture with Flask as the web framework and Socket.IO for real-time communication, following an application factory pattern.

**Core Components:**
-   **Backend**: Flask with Flask-SocketIO.
-   **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM, supporting SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production).
-   **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for WebSocket streaming with polling fallback.
-   **Frontend**: Bootstrap dark theme with vanilla JavaScript and Socket.IO client, adhering to a "Crown+" design system for a modern UI/UX.

**Data Model:**
The system primarily uses two models:
-   **Session Model**: Stores meeting metadata, configuration, and real-time processing parameters.
-   **Segment Model**: Contains individual transcription segments, including text, confidence scores, speaker information, timing, and language detection.

**Real-time Audio Processing Pipeline:**
A multi-stage pipeline handles audio:
1.  **Audio Capture & VAD**: Client-side MediaRecorder API with Voice Activity Detection and noise reduction.
2.  **Audio Buffering & Streaming**: Intelligent buffering and optimized WebSocket transmission via Socket.IO.
3.  **Server-side Processing**: Audio format conversion and data preparation.
4.  **Whisper Integration**: Streaming transcription via OpenAI Whisper API.
5.  **Real-time Broadcasting**: Results broadcast to clients via WebSocket.

**Service Layer:**
Business logic is organized into services like `TranscriptionService`, `VADService`, `WhisperStreamingService`, and `AudioProcessor`.

**Architectural Decisions & Features:**
-   **Production Readiness**: Focus on scalability, security, and reliability.
-   **Background Worker System**: Non-blocking transcription processing with thread pools.
-   **Continuous Audio Processing**: Overlapping context windows and sliding buffer management.
-   **Advanced Deduplication**: Text stability analysis and segment confirmation.
-   **Redis-based Scaling**: Horizontal Socket.IO scaling and distributed room management.
-   **WebSocket Reliability**: Auto-reconnection, heartbeat monitoring, and session recovery.
-   **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic session state checkpointing with Redis.
-   **Security & Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with RBAC, bcrypt password hashing, AES-256 encryption.
-   **Advanced Features**: Multi-speaker diarization, multi-language detection, adaptive VAD, real-time audio quality monitoring, and advanced confidence scoring.
-   **Accessibility & UX**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast/large text modes, and a consistent "Crown+" design system with 3 theme variants.
-   **Performance**: Achieved low Word Error Rate (WER) and sub-400ms end-to-end transcription latency.

**Development Strategy:**
A "Hybrid Approach" balances user-visible progress with production infrastructure. The roadmap includes phases for management/settings pages, codebase cleanup, quality/polish, critical foundation (testing, monitoring, security, CI/CD), SaaS business pages, and collaboration features.

## Recent Changes

### Phase 0: Foundation & Quality Infrastructure (October 2025) - IN PROGRESS
**Status**: 5 of 45 tasks complete

**Completed Infrastructure (Tasks 0.1, 0.2, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9):**

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- ✅ **pytest Setup** (T0.1): pytest-cov, pytest-mock, pytest-flask, pytest-html, pytest-playwright installed; pytest.ini with 80% coverage threshold, --cov-append, test markers, HTML/XML reports to tests/results/; .coveragerc scoped to application code
- ✅ **Playwright E2E** (T0.2): Playwright 1.55.0 with comprehensive async fixtures in tests/setup/conftest.py; mobile testing (iPhone 13), video recording always enabled, async screenshot-on-failure with error handling
- ✅ **Test Data Factories** (T0.6): 8 factories (User, Session, Segment, Meeting, Summary, Task, Workspace, Participant) using factory-boy and faker; batch creation helpers; complete meeting data generator; 9/9 tests passing
- ✅ **Integration Tests** (T0.7): tests/conftest.py with Flask app fixture using create_app() and test database; tests/integration/test_api_sessions.py with API endpoint tests; 4/4 passing

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** (T0.9): .github/workflows/ci.yml with 3 jobs: test (unit+integration with Postgres 13, DB init, coverage to Codecov), lint (Ruff+Black), security (Safety+Bandit with JSON reports); complements existing e2e-tests.yml; 18/18 tests passing

**Test Results:**
- 18 tests passing (9 unit + 4 integration + 5 app basic)
- Coverage enforced at 80% minimum
- All infrastructure architect-reviewed and approved

**Files Created/Enhanced:**
- tests/conftest.py: Root test configuration with Flask app, client, db_session fixtures
- tests/factories.py: 8 comprehensive test data factories
- tests/unit/: Unit tests for factories and app basics
- tests/integration/: Integration tests for API endpoints
- tests/setup/conftest.py: Playwright E2E fixtures
- .coveragerc: Coverage configuration excluding test/static/template files
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: Complete CI pipeline with test/lint/security jobs
- pytest.ini: Enhanced with --cov-append and coverage reporting

### Phase 1: Management & Settings Pages (October 2025) - COMPLETED
**Status**: 7 of 8 tasks complete (1 deferred to Phase 6)

**Completed Crown+ Transformations:**
- ✅ **Profile/Account Settings** (P1-T1): Personal info forms, password change, avatar upload with validation and AJAX submissions
- ✅ **Preferences Page** (P1-T3): 4-tab interface (Transcription, Notifications, Privacy, Appearance) with API persistence and proper value conversions

**Crown+ Design System Applied:**
- Glass morphism backgrounds with backdrop blur
- Purple accent color (#8b5cf6) throughout

- Consistent card layouts and spacing
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, reduced motion support

**Known Issues for Follow-up:**
