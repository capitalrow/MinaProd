# ðŸŽµ Production Feature: Continuous Audio Capture with Overlapping Context
"""
Implements continuous audio capture with overlapping context windows to prevent
cut-off phrases and improve transcription accuracy.

Addresses: "Streaming Transcription Pipeline" gap from production assessment.

Key Features:
- Overlapping audio contexts to prevent phrase cut-offs
- Sliding window buffer management
- Context-aware chunk processing
- Memory-efficient audio stream handling
