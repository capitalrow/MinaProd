TemporalRecoveryEngine Service - CROWN⁴.5 Event Sequence Recovery

Re-orders drifted events using vector clocks. Implements event replay with
sequence correction to guarantee zero sequence loss.

Key Features:
- Vector clock-based event ordering
- Detect and correct out-of-order events
- Replay events with proper sequencing
- Zero sequence loss guarantees
- Recovery from offline queue replay
