"""
Row-Level Security Context Middleware

This middleware sets the current user ID in Postgres session context before each
request, enabling Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to enforce data isolation.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Before each request, check if user is authenticated
2. If authenticated, set app.current_user_id in Postgres
3. RLS policies use this value to filter queries automatically
4. Users only see their own data (defense-in-depth security)

USAGE:
    from middleware.rls_context import set_rls_context
    
    def create_app():
        app = Flask(__name__)
        # ... app setup ...
        
        # Enable RLS context middleware
        set_rls_context(app)
        
        # ... rest of app setup ...
