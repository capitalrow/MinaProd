# 🚨 MINA UAT - Critical Findings Report

## Executive Summary
❌ **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Core audio capture pipeline is broken due to WebSocket session management issues

**Current Status**: 2/10 UAT criteria passing
- ✅ Dashboard loads successfully
- ✅ Navigation and UI responsive
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Microphone access completely blocked
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No audio streaming capability  
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No transcription functionality

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### **1. Preflight Checks - FAILED**

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Browser mic prompt | ❌ NEVER TRIGGERED | Session creation fails before mic access |
| Mic icon visible | ❌ NO | Input Level shows 0%, VAD shows "Waiting" |
| MediaRecorder.state | ❌ NEVER STARTED | No MediaRecorder initialization |
| WS connected | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Connects then immediately disconnects |
| Chunks sent > 0 | ❌ NO | No audio chunks transmitted |
| Server logs AUDIO_CHUNK | ❌ NO | No audio data received |

### **2. WebSocket Session Management - ROOT CAUSE**

**Critical Sequence Failure:**
```
1. Socket connects ✅
2. 'create_session' emitted ✅  
3. Session created (session ID: 26475bd7, 5885a7d9) ✅
4. Socket disconnects: "transport close" ❌ CRITICAL
5. Microphone access never attempted ❌
6. No audio streaming ❌
```

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
✅ Socket connected - Enhanced reliability active
🆕 Session created: 26475bd7
✅ Session joined successfully: {session_id: "26475bd7", ...}
❌ Socket disconnected: transport close  <-- CRITICAL FAILURE
```

### **3. Mobile-Specific Issues**

**Testing on Android Chrome reveals:**
- Socket.IO transport instability
- Possible mobile browser WebSocket limitations
- Session state not properly maintained after creation

## 🛠️ Required Fixes (Priority Order)

### **CRITICAL - Fix 1: WebSocket Session Stability**
**Problem**: Socket disconnects immediately after session creation
**Solution**: 
- Debug server-side session creation handler
- Add session persistence across socket reconnections
- Implement proper error handling for session state

### **CRITICAL - Fix 2: Microphone Permission Flow**
**Problem**: Microphone access never attempted due to session failure
**Solution**:
- Decouple microphone access from session creation
- Request mic permissions early in the flow
- Implement proper fallback handling

### **CRITICAL - Fix 3: Audio Streaming Pipeline**
**Problem**: No audio chunks being transmitted
**Solution**:
- Fix session lifecycle management
- Ensure MediaRecorder starts after successful session join
- Implement audio buffering for connection recovery

## 📊 UAT Scorecard (Current: 20/100)

| Category | Score | Status | Critical Issues |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Microphone & Audio** | 0/25 | ❌ FAILED | No mic access, no audio capture |
| **Live Transcription** | 0/25 | ❌ FAILED | No transcription possible |
| **Session Management** | 5/20 | ❌ CRITICAL | Sessions created but unstable |
| **WebSocket Reliability** | 2/15 | ❌ CRITICAL | Immediate disconnection |
| **UI/UX Responsiveness** | 8/10 | ✅ GOOD | Interface works well |
| **Error Handling** | 5/5 | ✅ GOOD | Proper error messages shown |

## 🧪 Failed UAT Test Cases

### **Test 1: Microphone & Audio Capture**
```
EXPECTED: Permission prompt → mic enabled → chunks_sent > 0
ACTUAL: Permission prompt never appears, chunks_sent = 0
STATUS: ❌ BLOCKED by session management failure
```

### **Test 2: Live Recording & Transcription**  
```
EXPECTED: Interim text ≤2s, final transcript ≤2s after pause
ACTUAL: No transcription possible due to audio pipeline failure
STATUS: ❌ BLOCKED by core infrastructure failure
```

### **Test 3: Session Persistence**
```
EXPECTED: Session persists, transcript saved
ACTUAL: Session disconnects immediately after creation
STATUS: ❌ CRITICAL session lifecycle bug
```

## 🎯 Immediate Action Items

### **Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (2-4 hours)**
1. **Debug server-side session creation** - investigate why socket disconnects
2. **Implement session recovery** - handle socket reconnection with existing session
3. **Add microphone permission pre-check** - decouple from session creation

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality (4-8 hours)**  
1. **Fix audio streaming pipeline** - ensure MediaRecorder → WebSocket flow works
2. **Implement proper session lifecycle** - creation → join → audio → transcription
3. **Add comprehensive error recovery** - handle all failure modes gracefully

### **Phase 3: Validation (2-4 hours)**
1. **Complete UAT re-test** - verify all critical paths work
2. **Cross-browser validation** - test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
3. **Mobile optimization** - ensure Android/iOS compatibility

## 🔧 Technical Recommendations

### **Server-Side Investigation Required**
- Check WebSocket event handlers for session creation
- Verify session persistence in database
- Audit socket disconnection triggers

### **Client-Side Improvements**
- Add session recovery on socket reconnection  
- Implement audio buffering during connection issues
- Add comprehensive error state management

### **Testing Strategy**
- Implement automated UAT with Playwright
- Add WebSocket connection monitoring
- Create fallback testing scenarios

## 📈 Success Criteria for Re-test

1. ✅ Microphone permission prompt appears on "Start Recording"
2. ✅ Socket remains connected throughout session lifecycle  
3. ✅ Audio chunks flowing: chunks_sent > 0 within 5 seconds
4. ✅ Interim transcripts appear within 2 seconds of speech
5. ✅ Final transcripts saved and persisted
6. ✅ Session management stable across reconnections

**Target UAT Score**: 85/100+ (from current 20/100)
