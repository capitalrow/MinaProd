# End-to-End Testing Strategy for Mina Transcription System

## Framework Selection: Playwright + pytest

**Justification:**
- **Playwright**: Excellent for real-time audio/video testing, WebSocket support, mobile simulation
- **pytest**: Robust Python testing framework with powerful fixtures and reporting
- **Real-time capabilities**: Can simulate audio input, test WebSocket connections
- **Cross-browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari testing
- **Mobile support**: Can simulate Pixel 9 Pro and other Android devices

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. Test Modes
- **Live Environment**: Full system with real OpenAI API (limited use)
- **Mock Environment**: Stubbed OpenAI responses for consistent testing
- **Offline Mode**: No external dependencies, pure functional testing

### 2. Test Data Strategy
- **Audio Files**: Pre-recorded test samples (various quality, length, languages)
- **Mock Responses**: Predictable transcription responses for assertions
- **Edge Cases**: Silent audio, noise, very long/short clips

## Critical User Journeys

### 1. Basic Transcription Flow
- Navigate to `/live`
- Start recording
- Speak test phrase
- Verify real-time transcription appears
- Stop recording
- Verify final transcript
- Copy transcript functionality

### 2. Real-time Processing
- Continuous speech transcription
- Sentence building and punctuation
- Live metrics updates (word count, accuracy, latency)
- Audio level visualization

### 3. Mobile Experience (Pixel 9 Pro)
- Touch interactions
- Audio permissions
- Network condition changes
- Battery optimization behavior
- Orientation changes

### 4. Error Handling
- Microphone permission denied
- Network disconnection
- API failures
- Audio processing errors
- Recovery mechanisms

## Edge Cases & Negative Testing

### 1. Input Validation
- No microphone available
- Browser audio not supported
- Silent audio input
- Very noisy audio
- Extremely long recordings

### 2. Network Conditions
- Slow connections (3G, 2G simulation)
- Intermittent connectivity
- High latency scenarios
- Connection drops during recording

### 3. Browser/Device Issues
- Page refresh during recording
- Tab switching
- Browser memory constraints
- Concurrent sessions

## Performance Testing

### 1. Load Testing
- Multiple concurrent users (10-50)
- Long recording sessions (5+ minutes)
- Rapid start/stop cycles
- Memory leak detection

### 2. Latency Testing
- Measure end-to-end transcription latency
- Real-time processing delays
- UI responsiveness
