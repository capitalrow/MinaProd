# Analytics Strategy

## Analytics Tool Selection (T0.37)

### Chosen Approach: Hybrid Analytics Stack

**Primary Solution**: Custom event tracking with optional third-party integrations

**Rationale**:
1. **Data Ownership**: Keep sensitive meeting data in our database
2. **Flexibility**: Custom metrics specific to meeting analytics
3. **Cost**: Avoid per-event pricing for high-volume transcription events
4. **Privacy**: GDPR/CCPA compliance easier with self-hosted
5. **Integration Ready**: Can add Mixpanel/Amplitude later

### Analytics Stack Components

1. **Custom Event Tracking** (Primary)
   - PostgreSQL for event storage
   - Python service for event collection
   - Real-time dashboard for product team
   
2. **Performance Monitoring** (Implemented)
   - Sentry for error tracking and APM
   - Custom performance monitoring service
   
3. **Optional Integrations** (Future)
   - Mixpanel: User journey analytics
   - Amplitude: Cohort analysis
   - PostHog: Self-hosted alternative

### Feature Flags
```python
def is_feature_enabled(user_id, feature_name):
    # Consistent bucketing based on user_id
    bucket = hash(f"{user_id}_{feature_name}") % 100
    
    feature_rollout = {
        'new_ai_summary': 50,  # 50% rollout
        'advanced_analytics': 100,  # 100% rollout
        'collaboration_v2': 0,  # Disabled
    }
    
    return bucket < feature_rollout.get(feature_name, 0)
```

### Test Variants
