# 0. Use Architecture Decision Records

**Date**: 2025-10-02

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to ensure that future team members understand why certain choices were made and to provide context for future modifications.

**Decision**: We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. Each ADR will be a numbered markdown file in the `docs/adr/` directory.

**Consequences**:
- All significant architectural decisions will be documented
- Team members can understand historical context
- Decision-making process becomes transparent
- Onboarding new developers becomes easier

**Format**: Each ADR follows this structure:
- Title (number and description)
- Date
- Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- Context (the issue motivating this decision)
- Decision (the change we're proposing or have agreed to)
- Consequences (positive and negative outcomes)
