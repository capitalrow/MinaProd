# 4. OpenAI Whisper API for Transcription

**Date**: 2025-10-02

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Mina's core functionality requires accurate, real-time speech-to-text transcription with support for multiple languages and speaker identification.

**Decision**: Use OpenAI Whisper API for audio transcription with custom streaming implementation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text: Good but more expensive
- AWS Transcribe: Good streaming but less accurate for specialized terminology
- Self-hosted Whisper: Lower cost but requires GPU infrastructure
- AssemblyAI: Good accuracy but higher latency

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**:
  - State-of-the-art accuracy (low Word Error Rate)
  - Multi-language support (99+ languages)
  - Handles technical terminology well
  - No infrastructure management required
  - Automatic punctuation and formatting
  
- **Negative**:
  - Per-minute API costs can add up at scale
  - Requires chunking strategy for streaming
  - Network latency impacts real-time performance
  - Vendor lock-in to OpenAI
