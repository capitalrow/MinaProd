---

## 🎯 PHASE 1: LAUNCH & LEARN (Month 1-2)
### Target: 10-50 Concurrent Users

#### **Launch Strategy**
- **Deploy with Replit Autoscale Deployments** - automatic scaling with pay-per-use
- **Baseline Configuration**: 1vCPU, 2GB RAM per instance
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale to zero when idle, auto-add instances during load
- **Cost**: Only pay for actual usage (~$50-150/month initially)

#### **Critical Monitoring Setup**
```python
# Key Performance Indicators (Phase 1)
KPIs = {
    "concurrent_sessions": {"target": "<50", "alert": ">40"},
    "memory_growth_rate": {"target": "<10MB/hour", "alert": ">50MB/hour"},
    "transcription_latency": {"target": "<400ms", "alert": ">500ms"},
    "websocket_success_rate": {"target": ">99%", "alert": "<98%"},
    "database_query_time": {"target": "<50ms P95", "alert": ">100ms"},
    "api_error_rate": {"target": "<1%", "alert": ">5%"}
}
```

#### **Real User Learning Objectives**
1. **Peak Usage Patterns**: When do users transcribe most?
2. **Session Duration**: How long are typical sessions?
3. **Audio Quality**: What's the typical audio input quality?
4. **Geographic Distribution**: Where are users located?
5. **Device Patterns**: Mobile vs. desktop usage ratios

#### **Phase 1 Success Criteria**
- [ ] Zero production incidents lasting >5 minutes
