**Mina - Enterprise-Grade Incident Management**

## Overview

This document defines procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. All team members must be familiar with these protocols to ensure rapid, effective response.

**Status:** âœ… Production-ready  
**Compliance:** SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA  
**Last Updated:** October 2025  
**Review Frequency:** Quarterly

---

## Incident Classification

### ðŸ”´ P0 - Critical (Immediate Response)

**Response Time:** < 15 minutes  
**Examples:**
- Active data breach or exfiltration
- Ransomware attack in progress
- Production system completely down
- Credentials leaked publicly (GitHub, Pastebin, etc.)
- Zero-day exploit being actively exploited
- Customer PII/PHI exposure confirmed

**Actions:**
1. Activate incident commander immediately
2. Notify CEO, CTO, legal team
3. Begin containment within 15 minutes
4. Document every action in incident log

---

### ðŸŸ  P1 - High (Urgent Response)

**Response Time:** < 1 hour  
**Examples:**
- Suspicious admin access detected
- Multiple failed authentication attempts (possible brute force)
- Unauthorized database access
- DDoS attack affecting service
- Vulnerability scanner detected in logs
- API key rotation overdue >7 days

**Actions:**
1. Assign incident lead
2. Notify security team and engineering lead
3. Begin investigation within 1 hour
4. Implement temporary mitigations

---

### ðŸŸ¡ P2 - Medium (Standard Response)

**Response Time:** < 4 hours  
**Examples:**
- Malware detected on employee workstation
- Phishing email reported by user
- Minor service degradation
- Non-critical vulnerability discovered
- Unusual traffic patterns detected
- Session anomaly detected

**Actions:**
1. Log incident in tracking system
2. Assign to security team member
3. Investigate within 4 hours
4. Schedule remediation

---

### ðŸŸ¢ P3 - Low (Routine Response)

**Response Time:** < 24 hours  
**Examples:**
- Security scan finding (non-exploitable)
- Outdated library with no known CVE
- Policy violation (minor)
- False positive alert
- Security awareness training reminder

**Actions:**
1. Create ticket in issue tracker
2. Review during next security sync
3. Address during regular sprint

---

## Incident Response Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Detection & Analysis

**Detection Sources:**
- Sentry error tracking (SENTRY_DSN)
- Uptime monitoring (BetterStack)
- Failed login alerts (auth logs)
- Rate limit violations (middleware/limits.py)
- Database anomaly detection
- User reports (support tickets)
- Security scans (OWASP ZAP, automated)

**Initial Analysis:**
```bash
# 1. Check recent logs
tail -n 500 /var/log/mina/app.log | grep -i "error\|unauthorized\|403\|401"

# 2. Review Sentry for errors
# https://sentry.io/organizations/mina/issues/

# 3. Check database for suspicious queries
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';"

# 4. Review auth logs
grep "login" /var/log/mina/app.log | tail -n 100

# 5. Check rate limit violations
grep "Rate limit exceeded" /var/log/mina/app.log | tail -n 50
```

**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**
- Unexpected outbound connections
- Database queries at unusual hours
- Multiple failed auth from same IP
- Large data exports (>1GB)
- Modified system files
- Disabled security controls
- New admin users created

---

### Phase 2: Containment

**Immediate Containment (< 15 minutes for P0):**

```bash
# 1. Block malicious IP immediately
# Option A: Via Python console (security_config.py has block_ip method)
python3 -c "
from app import app
from security_config import SecurityConfig
with app.app_context():
    sec = SecurityConfig(app)
    sec.block_ip('MALICIOUS_IP', 'Active attack - Incident #123')
"

# Option B: Via upstream firewall/WAF (Cloudflare, Replit config)
# Or implement /ops/block-ip endpoint in routes/ops.py

# 2. Disable compromised user account
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "UPDATE users SET is_active = false WHERE id = 'USER_ID';"

# 3. Rotate compromised credentials IMMEDIATELY
./scripts/rotate_secrets.sh SESSION_SECRET
./scripts/rotate_secrets.sh API_SECRET_KEY

# 4. Enable emergency rate limiting (more strict)
# Update middleware/limits.py:
# 'api': {'requests': 10, 'window': 300}  # 10 req/5min (emergency mode)

# 5. Take database backup before any remediation
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > /backups/incident_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

**Short-term Containment (< 1 hour for P1):**

```bash
# 1. Enable maintenance mode
# Set MAINTENANCE_MODE=true in Replit Secrets
# Application detects this and returns 503 for all requests
# (Implement via before_request hook in app.py if not yet added)

# 2. Isolate affected services
# If database compromised: Create read-only replica, point app there
# If API compromised: Disable API endpoints temporarily

# 3. Preserve evidence
# Copy logs before rotation
cp /var/log/mina/app.log /evidence/incident_logs_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

# 4. Notify affected users (if data exposed)
# See "Communication Protocols" section below
```

---

### Phase 3: Eradication

**Remove Threat:**

```bash
# 1. Patch vulnerabilities
# Update dependencies
pip install --upgrade $(pip list --outdated | awk 'NR>2 {print $1}')
npm update

# 2. Remove malicious code/backdoors
# Review recent git commits
git log --since="2 days ago" --all --oneline
git diff HEAD~10 HEAD  # Review last 10 commits

# 3. Reset all compromised accounts
# Force password reset for affected users
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "UPDATE users SET password_must_change = true WHERE id IN (...);"

# 4. Revoke all active sessions
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id IN (...);"

# 5. Clean up malicious database entries
# Review and remove injected data
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DELETE FROM suspicious_table WHERE created_at > '2025-10-01 12:00:00';"
```

**Harden Systems:**

```bash
# 1. Update CSP headers (if XSS involved)
# Edit middleware/csp.py to stricter policy

# 2. Enable additional monitoring
# Add Sentry breadcrumbs for sensitive operations
# Update routes/auth.py to log all auth events

# 3. Implement additional controls
# Add IP allowlist for admin panel
# Require 2FA for admin accounts (future enhancement)

# 4. Apply security patches
# Check for Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc. security updates
pip install --upgrade flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-wtf
```

---

### Phase 4: Recovery

**Restore Normal Operations:**

```bash
# 1. Verify threat eliminated
# Run security scan
python scripts/security_audit.py

# 2. Restore from backup (if needed)
# Restore database to last known good state
pg_restore -d $DATABASE_URL /backups/pre_incident_backup.sql

# 3. Gradually restore services
# Disable maintenance mode
unset MAINTENANCE_MODE

# 4. Monitor closely for 24-48 hours
# Watch for recurrence
tail -f /var/log/mina/app.log | grep -i "error\|unauthorized"

# 5. Validate all systems functioning
curl https://your-app.replit.app/ops/health
# Check all endpoints return 200
```

**Post-Recovery Validation:**
- [ ] All services responding normally
- [ ] No unauthorized access detected (24h monitoring)
- [ ] Backups verified and current
- [ ] Credentials rotated and verified
- [ ] Monitoring alerts functioning
- [ ] Users can access their accounts
- [ ] Data integrity confirmed
